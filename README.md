# PHP Docker Development Skeleton

## Overview

This repository provides a minimal PHP development environment using Docker.
Development tools are isolated using [bamarni/composer-bin-plugin](https://github.com/bamarni/composer-bin-plugin), ensuring production dependencies remain unaffected by tooling requirements.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmitrii-t/php-docker-skeleton.git my-project
cd my-project
```

> ðŸ“Œ After cloning this repository, please ensure you update the origin remote to point to your own repository if you intend to push changes

### 2. Build and start the Docker environment

```bash
just up
```

This command builds the PHP Docker image and launches the project using Docker Compose.

### 3. Install Composer dependencies

```bash
just install-all-composer
```

Installs all development tools using isolated Composer bins.
